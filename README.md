# IQ Puzzler Pro Solver Bruteforce

### Description
IQ Puzzler Pro is a board game with the goal of fitting an amount of pieces into the board. The board is a rectangle shape with **n x m dimension**. A sequence of pieces is considered a solution if all the pieces are placed on the board and the board is filled.

The algorithm implemented is a **bruteforce algorithm with recursive backtracking** ensuring every piece that are placed on the board is considered valid. The algorithm ensures an output for the input if possible.
